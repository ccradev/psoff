Welcome to the privacy policy of the app "psoff". In this document, I'll try to make clear how your data is used by me. Without anything else to say, let me begin...

## Terms

In order to let you understand correctly our privacy policy, you need to know these terms:

- AdMob: a service provided by Google that allows developers to add advertisement
  to their apps on Android or iOS. Official link: https://www.google.es/admob/
- OneSignal: a service that provides developers the ability to send notifications to their
  websites or apps easily and allow developers to see how the notifications perform
  (statistics about how the notifications are received, such as received, clicked, failed)
- Data or information: this means anything that we collect.

## What data do I collect?

I (ccradev) don't collect your data directly nor have access to it. 

The following product DO collect your data:

Here is a description of what are these services and what they collect:

- OneSignal: this service is for sending notifications to you. It collects the numbers of how many people have subscribed to the notifications/stopped receiving notifications/etc. You can [read their Privacy Policy here](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy) and know what they do with your data.
